# MetaMask Agoric Plugin

Built for the [2019 SF Blockchain Week DeFi Hackahton](https://hackathon.sfblockchainweek.io/).

A [MetaMask Plugin](https://medium.com/metamask/introducing-the-next-evolution-of-the-web3-wallet-4abdf801a4ee) capable of allowing a MetaMask user to interact with Dapps on the [Agoric blockchain](https://github.com/agoric/agoric).

This is the first plugin that allows MetaMask to connect to a non-Ethereum blockchain!

Notable in part because the MetaMask plugin system is itself built on Agoric's [Secure EcmaScript](https://github.com/agoric/ses) project, which is also the runtime for their blockchain.
